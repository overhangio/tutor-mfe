# Changelog

This file includes a history of past releases. Changes that were not yet added to a release are in the [changelog.d/](./changelog.d) folder.

<!--
⚠️ DO NOT ADD YOUR CHANGES TO THIS FILE! (unless you want to modify existing changelog entries in this file)
Changelog entries are managed by scriv. After you have made some changes to this plugin, create a changelog entry with:

    scriv create

Edit and commit the newly-created file in changelog.d.

If you need to create a new release, create a separate commit just for that. It is important to respect these
instructions, because git commits are used to generate release notes:
  - Modify the version number in `__about__.py`.
  - Collect changelog entries with `scriv collect`
  - The title of the commit should be the same as the new version: "vX.Y.Z".

## v18.0.1 (2024-09-09)

- [Feature] Introduce a "mfe-dockerfile-base" patch to customise the base layer of the "mfe" Docker image. (by @regisb)

- [Feature] Introduce a `MFE_DOCKER_IMAGE_DEV_PREFIX` setting to customize dev MFE image docker repos. (by @rediris)

<a id='changelog-18.0.0'></a>
## v18.0.0 (2024-06-19)

- 💥[Feature] Upgrade to Redwood (by @hinakhadim)
- [Feature] Enable `atlas pull` on all Micro-frontends. (by @omarithawi)
- 💥[Feature] Use `ATLAS_OPTIONS` for `atlas pull`. This breaks the `i18n-merge.js` custom locale Tutor MFE feature in favor of [OEP-58](https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/concepts/oep58.html) `atlas pull` options. (by @omarithawi)

<a id='changelog-17.0.1'></a>
## v17.0.1 (2024-03-26)

- [Feature] Add a new `mfe-dockerfile-production-final` patch to define additional instructions in the final image. (by @MoisesGSalas)
- [Bugfix] Fix MFE runtime config via site configuration in dev mode (by @arbrandes).
- [Bugfix] Make plugin compatible with Python 3.12 by removing dependency on `pkg_resources`. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Make sure course-authoring mfe is present in `MFE_APPS` before applying cms-development-settings. (by @Danyal-Faheem)
- [Bugfix] Fix issue of `MFE_HOST` url redirection to `LMS_HOST` (by @hinakhadim)
- [Bugfix] Added the learner-dashboard-dev image to the gitlab ci. (by @Danyal-Faheem)

<a id='changelog-17.0.0'></a>
## v17.0.0 (2023-12-09)

- 💥Upgrade to Quince (by @regisb).
- 💥[Improvement] If you implement the `MFE_APPS` filter with a custom GitHub repository, you must make sure to add the ".git" extension to the URL. For instance: `"repository": "https://github.com/username/frontend-app-learning.git"`. This is because we changed the way we git-clone MFE repositories. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Added Makefile and test action to repository and formatted code with Black and isort. (by @CodeWithEmad)
- [Feature] Add support for the Learner Dashboard MFE. (by @arbrandes)
- [Bugfix] Append trailing slash to `PUBLIC_PATH`, as its absence breaks some MFEs. (by @arbrandes)
- [Feature] Added patch to allow changes to Dockerfile after the npm build has completed. (by @Danyal-Faheem)
- [Bugfix] Auto-build "mfe" image during `dev/local launch` in nightly. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] Specify port for dev server to listen on (by @michaelwheeler)
- [Feature] Enable the new per-unit discussions sidebar in the Learning MFE. (by @arbrandes)
- [Bugfix] Support MFE remotes that are not on GitHub. (by @gabor-boros and @regisb)
- 💥[Bugfix] Bypass rate-limiting when checking for upstream git changes. To achieve that, we use the `ADD --keep-git-dir` option, which is only compatible with BuildKit 0.11, from January 2023. Also, we get rid of the `get_github_refs_path` function. (by @gabor-boros and @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.3'></a>
## v16.1.3 (2023-12-07)

- [Improvement] Added Makefile and test action to repository and formatted code with Black and isort. (by @CodeWithEmad)
- [Bugfix] Fix image build/pull/push when 3rd-party microfrontends are bind-mounted. (by @regisb)
- [Feature] Introduce a `get_mfe(name)` template function to make it easier to write patches. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.2'></a>
## v16.1.2 (2023-11-06)

- [Improvement] Include additional patches in the Dockerfile to add instructions just before the build step. (by @MoisesGSalas)
- [Improvement] Allow to patch MFE Caddyfile. (by @snglth)
- [Feature] The new `CONFIG_LOADED` action checks if `MFE_HOST` is a subdomain of `LMS_HOST`. If not, display a warning message to the user. (by @CodeWithEmad)
- [Bugfix] Fix automated image building in nightly. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.1.1'></a>
## v16.1.1 (2023-08-28)

- [Bugfix] Add `INFO_EMAIL` and `PASSWORD_RESET_SUPPORT_LINK` missing variables defaults of `CONTACT_EMAIL` and `mailto:{{ CONTACT_EMAIL }}` respectfully. These two variables help build the "Forgot Password" screen. (by @misilot)
- [Bugfix] Corrected typo error in `PROFILE_MICROFRONTEND_URL` of development env settings. (by @kiran1415)

<a id='changelog-16.1.0'></a>
## v16.1.0 (2023-08-03)

- [Improvement] Allow patching the Dockerfile per MFE. (by @arbrandes)
- [Improvement] Invalidate build cache for individual MFEs if there were upstream changes. (by @arbrandes)
- [Improvement] Don't override `imagePullPolicy` in Kubernetes. This was only necessary in older releases. (by @regisb)
- [Improvement] Select GitHub refs API endpoint based on version suffix. (by @arbrandes)
- 💥[Improvement] Fix very high CPU and memory usage in development. We resolve this issue by running just a single container for all MFES, just like in production. To allow developers to test their changes in Tutor, we run `npm run start` only for those MFEs that have a manual bind-mount that was created with `tutor mounts add .../frontend-app-mymfe`. (by @regisb)
- [Bugfix] In development, fix link to profile in header. (by @regisb)

<a id='changelog-16.0.0'></a>
## v16.0.0 (2023-06-14)

- 💥[Feature] upgrade to Palm. With this new release, we make use of persistent bind-mounts to make it much easier to work on MFE forks. In addition, adding new MFEs is no longer done with `*_MFE_APP` settings, which was awkward, but with appropriate plugins. (by @regisb)
    - Add support for the ORA Grading MFE: The MFE is accessible by instructors in ORA exercises that have explicit staff grading steps.  The corresponding waffle flag is installed and enabled by default. (by @arbrandes)
    - Add support for the Communications MFE: The MFE is usable by instructors to send bulk email to learners in a course. The feature itself (the ability to send bulk email) pre-dates this MFE, and must be enabled as usual for the "Email" tab to become visible in the Instructor Dashboard.  The difference is that with this change, the tab will include a link to the MFE by default.
    - upgrade node to v18

<a id='changelog-15.0.7'></a>
## v15.0.7 (2023-05-26)

- [Bugfix] Fix un-clickable "account" menu item. (by @ghassanmas and @regisb)
- [Improvement] Add a scriv-compliant changelog. (by @regisb)
