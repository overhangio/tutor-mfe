  This allows users to add custom content into their Caddy configurations in an equivalent manner to the [caddyfile-lms patch](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor/blob/release/tutor/templates/apps/caddy/Caddyfile#L59) and [caddyfile-cms patch](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor/blob/release/tutor/templates/apps/caddy/Caddyfile#L76).
